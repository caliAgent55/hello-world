# hello-world
Starting point for coding journey. Starter projects. 
Starting my coding journey pretty late into my professional career but with lots of motivation to succeed, and a great support network to ensure I stay focused and fulfill my goals. 
I like making tacos at home, and trying out new recipes I find on TikTok.
